In this paper, a model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and self-attention mechanism is proposed to analyze the dynamic relationship between step frequency, step length and rhythm changes during running. The model uses LSTM to capture the long-term dependence of time series data, and uses the self-attention mechanism to enhance the attention to key features, so as to achieve high-precision fitting of running rhythm. The experimental results based on 5 km running data show that the fitting error of the model on the training set and the test set reaches the order of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-4}$ respectively, which is significantly better than that of traditional LSTM and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The results show that the self-attention mechanism effectively improves the model's ability to learn complex motion features through global correlation sequence information, and provides theoretical support for real-time feedback and optimization strategies for scientific running training.
