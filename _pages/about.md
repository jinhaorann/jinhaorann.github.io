I am a graduate student in the Department of Applied Mathematics of Northeast Normal University. My supervisor is Professor Ji Shuguan. After obtaining a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and applied Mathematics in Northeast Normal University, I was recommended to pursue postgraduate studies. At present, I am an exchange student in the University of the Greater Bay Area, and my tutor is Professor Zhang Hongkun from the University of Massachusetts.

Research
======
I am interested in the intersection of deep learning and dynamical systems and work on how deep learning techniques can help understand the behavior of dynamical systems. In the process of leading undergraduate students in scientific research, I also built other applications of classical neural network models. Here are the machine learning systems I created:

1. Model running data using LSTM with self-attention mechanism
