I am a graduate student in the Department of Applied Mathematics of Northeast Normal University. My supervisor is Professor Shuguan Ji. After obtaining a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and applied Mathematics in Northeast Normal University, I was recommended to pursue postgraduate studies. At present, I am an exchange student in Greater Bay University, and my tutor is Professor Hongkun Zhang from the University of Massachusetts.

Research
======
I am interested in the intersection of deep learning and dynamical systems and work on how deep learning techniques can help understand the behavior of dynamical systems. In the process of leading undergraduate students in scientific research, I also built other applications of classical neural network models. Here are the machine learning systems I created:

1. Neural Network Method Based on Physics Knowledge to Solve Maxwell's Equations (Obtained Excellent graduation thesis)
2. Model running data using LSTM with self-attention mechanism

Updates
======
Here is my latest update

1. Sept. 2020 | I started studying in Northeast Normal University
2. Oct.  2021 | I started working for Zhuke (Beijing) Agricultural Technology Co., LTD
3. Sept. 2023 | I was eligible for the postgraduate recommendation
4. Jun.  2024 | I completed my graduation design and won the excellent graduation thesis
5. Sept. 2024 | I started my postgraduate study in Northeast Normal University under the supervision of Professor Shuguan Ji
6. Mar.  2025 | I came to Greater Bay University to study under Professor Hongkun Zhang from the University of Massachusetts
