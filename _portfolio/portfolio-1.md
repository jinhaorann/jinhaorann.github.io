title: "Employing an LSTM model with a self-attention mechanism to model variations in running pace"
excerpt: "In this paper, a model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and self-attention mechanism is proposed to analyze the dynamic relationship between step frequency, step length and rhythm changes during running. The model uses LSTM to capture the long-term dependence of time series data, and uses the self-attention mechanism to enhance the attention to key features, so as to achieve high-precision fitting of running rhythm.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
